# MNIST classification taks 
The purpose of the current work is to implementa a simple MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and the backpropagation algorithm, without specialized libries as pytorch or tensorflow, to classify images from the MNIST dataset, this with the objective to prove the simplicity behind these kind of models

## Data
MNIST is a widely-used image dataset of
